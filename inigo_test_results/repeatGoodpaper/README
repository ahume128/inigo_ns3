MTU = 1500 Bytes
buffer size = link bandwidth * maximum RT propagation time
***initial congestion window = 3 segments
receiver window size and ***initial ssthres = value greater than the pipe network capacity 

1 source, 1 sink, 2 routeres
links between sources/sinks and routers are 1Gbps
bottleneck link is between routers
2Mbps bottleneck link
RTT 250ms

***ten reverse OnOFF flows
on from t=250s-500s, t=750s to t=1000s
