attempt to replicate results in TCP Westwood(+) Protocol Implementation in ns-3

experimental setup is very similar to original experiment:

PointToPointHelper
Access link bandwidth 10Mb/s
Bottleneck link bandwidth 2Mb/s
Access link propogation delay 45ms
Bottleneck link propogation delay 0.01ms
Packet MTU size 400 B
Uniform Error Model
Error Rate 0.005
Bulk send application
Simulation time 600s
Queue length calculated using BDP

These are already the default values in the code:
	Delayed ACK count 2 segments
	Delayed ACK timeout 200ms
