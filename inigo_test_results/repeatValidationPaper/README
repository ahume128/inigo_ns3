attempt to replicate results in Implementation and Validation of TCP Options and Congestion Control Algorithms for ns-3
specifically Figure 1 which compares TCP NewReno in ns-3 and Linux, delay 25ms and 10^-3 packet loss

ns-3 version from paper: ns3-3.22

setup:
two nodes connected by a point-to-point channel with a PacketSink Application on receiver and BulkSendApplication on the sender

Bottleneck link bandwidth 10Mb/s
Bottleneck link propogation delay 25ms
Packet MTU size 1500 B  
Uniform Error Model
Error Rate 10^-3
Simulation time 350s
Queue length calculated using:
      trunc(15*12500000*${i}*10^-3/1524) where i is 25
Initial cWnd 10 packets
Initial ssThresh 10 packets

****original testing code is actually based on this paper
got test from: http://code.nsnam.org/nat/ns-3-dev-socis2014/rev/4d3485c7a97f but couldn't get it to perform tracing for some reason
modified current experiment instead

Other details:
      DelAckCount set to 1
      They turned off fast retransmit - trying first with it on to see what results look like

      Turned off fast retransmit by doing this in tcp-socket-base.cc:
    .AddAttribute ("ReTxThreshold", "Threshold for fast retransmit",
                    UintegerValue (100000000),
