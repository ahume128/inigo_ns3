first attempt to recreate simple mininet result. 

description of mininet test: Host links are 500Mbps, bottleneck is 100Mbps with a queue size of 100 packets, RTT is 4ms. I ran it for 100s.

64 kB MSS

NOTE: the test in here is the first iteration of queue tracing. adding tracing source and callback for m_nPackets in the queue implementation
